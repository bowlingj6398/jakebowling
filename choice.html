        <!--too lazy to fix this right now-->
        <div id="text-container" data-file="text/choice1.txt">All the Light We Cannot See follows a sad story, with many tragedies hurting the lives of the main characters, reshaping their lives. However, I learned how differently people handle war and how they can survive in difficult conditions. The main characters, Werner and Marie, went through very different stories, being German and French, respectively. Additionally, Marie was blind and had a loving father and uncle, while Werner lived at an orphanage and ended up joining the Hitler youth because of his talents and intelligence. However, even though Werner joined the side we mostly consider evil, his life and situation forced it upon him, and I feel sympathetic for him throughout the novel. Marie Laure’s father, who patiently taught her to find her way around and read, went missing during the story, a heartbreaking event that caused her uncle to show that he cared for her as well, being a very wholesome character during a difficult time. Overall, I found the book very interesting, as the characters’ stories got closer and closer together until they collided and, although temporarily, helped eachother, reiterating the kindness and good they expressed throughout the novel, even in situations that changed the course of their lives for the worse. All of this explained to me that the world is unfair, and even those with the best intentions can face terrible tragedy that alters their life.</div>
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <script src="scripts/fetchtext.js"></script>
        <div id="text-container" data-file="text/choice2.txt">Throughout the novel All the Light We Cannot See, Anthony Doerr employs careful nonlinear structuring of the story alongside an expression the issues World War II wreaked on the lives of ordinary people. As the main characters, Werner and Marie Laure, get closer to meeting, the chapters get shorter and shorter while their stories get closer together. For example, while Marie plays broadcasts on the radio as three of the characters are in the same area, the chapters are sequentially named “Music #1”, “Music #2” and “Music #3”, describing the perspectives of Marie, Werner, and Von Rumpel (Doerr, 452-457) . Not only do the chapter titles emphasize the proximity of the characters to eachother, but each chapter being very short reveals how their thoughts are all happening in very quick succession, almost coinciding simultaneously. This explains how, even though the characters are all seeking very different things, all of their paths colliding are foreshadowed by their distance from eachother, creating tension in the story. Near the beginning of the novel, the timeline jumps from “[Part] Zero: 7 August 1944” (Doerr, 1) to “[Part] One: 1934” (Doerr, 17). The start of the novel being in the future foreshadows the hardships the characters face throughout the novel, and are contrasted with the earlier, calm lives of the characters. Even though the characters stories are separated by chapters, the structure implies that their paths will eventually meet. The issues presented in the story are not only caused by the war, but also the lives of the characters. Werner, separated from his parents, lives in poverty at an orphanage and forms a family there that he is torn away from as the war is about to begin. Marie Laure struggles to fit in like Werner, and has trouble learning due to her blindness, but has the supportive company of her father who disappears during the war. The characters were already facing extremely difficult lives, and the calamity of war exacerbates that.</div>
