My name is Jake Bowling. I am a long time cellist and programmer and will go out of my way to make my work look clean for no reason. Although I don't enjoy english classes or writing (especially about myself), I like being able to occasionally express myself with unnecessary projects like this custom website. I love learning new things, especially things like math or science that strengthens my brain. I have one dog named Otto (I'll add a picture here later, it's kind of painful to format in html) and I love travelling.
