All the Light We Cannot See follows a sad story, with many tragedies hurting the lives of the main characters, reshaping their lives. However, I learned how differently people handle war and how they can survive in difficult conditions. The main characters, Werner and Marie, went through very different stories, being German and French, respectively. Additionally, Marie was blind and had a loving father and uncle, while Werner lived at an orphanage and ended up joining the Hitler youth because of his talents and intelligence. However, even though Werner joined the side we mostly consider evil, his life and situation forced it upon him, and I feel sympathetic for him throughout the novel. Marie Laure’s father, who patiently taught her to find her way around and read, went missing during the story, a heartbreaking event that caused her uncle to show that he cared for her as well, being a very wholesome character during a difficult time. Overall, I found the book very interesting, as the characters’ stories got closer and closer together until they collided and, although temporarily, helped eachother, reiterating the kindness and good they expressed throughout the novel, even in situations that changed the course of their lives for the worse. All of this explained to me that the world is unfair, and even those with the best intentions can face terrible tragedy that alters their life.
